# Document Q&A Assistant


*A Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system for querying document content using natural language processing.*

---

## Overview
The **Document Q&A Assistant** is an advanced tool designed to process and query document content efficiently. Built with a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) architecture, it allows users to upload PDF and image files, extract text (including via OCR), and ask questions based on the document content. Leveraging state-of-the-art natural language processing (NLP) techniques, the system retrieves relevant information from the documents and provides precise answers through an intuitive web interface. This project demonstrates a practical application of AI in document management and information retrieval, suitable for educational, research, and professional use cases.

## Objectives
- Enable users to upload and process multiple document types (PDFs, PNGs, JPGs).  
- Extract text from documents, including scanned images, using client-side OCR.  
- Store document content in a vector database for efficient retrieval.  
- Provide a user-friendly interface for querying documents with natural language.  
- Ensure modularity and scalability through a well-structured codebase.
